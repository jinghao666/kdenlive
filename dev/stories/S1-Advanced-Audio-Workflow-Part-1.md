## Choose default clip channels

* Every channel in the input clip has a meaning. Allow to add a description, e.g. CH1: Voice L, CH2: Voice R, CH3: Sound fx mono
* For each channel, allow to define the default target channel when the clip is inserted in the timeline.
* When inserted in the timeline, the clip should play with the selected channel mapping.

## Change clip channel mapping

When a clip is already in the timeline, allow to change the channel mapping.
