# Development Workflow

## Issues

Issue priority is assigned with the labels ~P1 to ~P4. Their meaning is currently [borrowed from GitLab][gl-prio].

| Label | Priority |
| --- | --- |
| `~P1` | Fix within 30 days (for the current release as hotfix, or for the next release if close)  |
| `~P2` | Fix for the next release |
| `~P3` | Fix within 2 releases |
| `~P4` | No need to fix within the next 3 releases |
