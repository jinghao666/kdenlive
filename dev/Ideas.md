*This page contains ideas for future development which still need refinement.*

# UI and UX

| Topic | Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Improved keyframe editing** | | For example, edit all keyframes together: #259 |
| **Project Bin improvements** | | Improve visual clarity and UX for project bin. For example, add a bit of spacing between clip entries, fix #283. See also #287, #291 |
| **Improve effect experience** | Applying effects is faster | Improve visual clarity of the effects list (coloured number boxes do not help too much e.g.), keep looping a zone while modifying effects (see #293), check if interactions work (e.g. scrolling has a double assignment: It scrolls the effect properties page, but also the keyframe item). See also #350 |
| **Workspaces for specialised workflows** | Faster editing in an editing stage | Change what widgets are shown and how Kdenlive behaves depending on the current editing stage (audio, effects, color correction, …); see #407 |
