# Next Café 2020


## Topics to discuss

### Number format

How to proceed with number format (#78)? 

* Possible solutions
* What to keep in mind (like fixing existing projects)
* Next steps, who, when

### Roadmap workflow discussion/suggestions

Very up to community if that is desired!

* Proposed Workflow
  1. Start with ideas on [Ideas](dev/Ideas)
  2. Create a separate page for ideas which are ready to discuss
  3. Brainstorming e.g. in a Café how to implement this idea (mainly from a user perspective)
  4. Planning of development steps in a way that allows other devs to join
  5. Add steps to roadmap
* Why this workflow?
  * Make current goals visible
  * Discuss features (and maybe alternative solutions) together
  * Talk about priorities and [MLPs][mlp]
  * New devs can easily start working on a task right after joining

### Next important topics

* Pick one or two topics from the Ideas page and discuss them
* What is in for the next minor/major version?
